You can feel fresh, dry and protected all day long, and your outfits will stay just as protected as you are. After all, the best fashion accessory is no sweat or deodorant spray stains. The unbeatable anti-sweat Microtechnology provides 2x more powerful protection*, so you're always ready for whatever your day throws at you. Our innovative MotionSense technology releases bursts of fresh, pure fragrance when you need it most. It works like this: unique microcapsules sit on the surface of your skin.

Because when you work hard, Sure works harder. Sure. It won't let you down. Get all-day freshness and 72-hour non-stop protection that works in sync with your body for non-stop confidence from morning to night. Wear what you like. Move when you want.

You can feel fresh, dry and protected all-day long and your garments will stay as protected as you are. After all, surely the best fashion accessory is no sweat or anti-perspirant stains. The unbeatable anti-sweat Microtechnology provides 2x more powerful protection*, so you're always ready for whatever your day throws at you. Our innovative MotionSense technology releases bursts of freshness when you need it most. It works like this: unique microcapsules sit on the surface of your skin. When you move, friction breaks those microcapsules releasing more fragrance. So, the more you move, the more it protects. That freshness stays with you no matter how hard you push yourself. Because when you work hard, Sure works harder. Sure. It won't let you down. Get all-day freshness and 72-hour non-stop protection that works in sync with your body for non-stop confidence from morning to night. Wear what you like. Move when you want. You know you're protected. How to use: Firstly, shake the anti-perspirant women's deodorant spray can. Then hold it 15 centimetres away from your underarm and spray evenly in a well-ventilated area.

preparationAndUsage
 Tip 1: Warm water softens thick and stubborn hairs and allows for more of the hair to be exposed from beneath the skin. Wash your face thoroughly for about two to three minutes before shaving for an optimal result. <br />Tip 2: For a particularly close shave, use shaving gel or soap. This also ensures that the blades of your razor glide easily over the skin, protecting against shaving irritation. Shave without pressure. <br />Tip 3: After shaving, cool water not only removes hair debris and residual shaving gel, but also closes the pores of your skin, for a smooth finish.<br />Tip 4: Replace the blades of your Wilkinson Sword razor regularly (depending on your shaving routine). If you find your blade no longer glides easily over the skin, it's time to change. Dull blades cannot shave as thoroughly and are more likely to cause skin irritation as you push harder against your skin.","{'bc1': 'Toiletries & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Mens Toiletries', 'bc3': 'Razors & Blades', 'bc4': 'Blades'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/90a812d7-e1c0-49ae-a417-3c8a194fe16e/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/wilkinson-sword-hydro-3-skin-protection-razor-blades/113289058,9.3,male,male,none,male,black,0.6385618432713002,black,0.16426129889859475,gray,0.06019749335358906,True,,,,

preparationAndUsage
 Tip 1: Warm water softens thick and stubborn hairs and allows for more of the hair to be exposed from beneath the skin. Wash your face thoroughly for about two to three minutes before shaving for an optimal result. <br />Tip 2: For a particularly close shave, use shaving gel or soap. This also ensures that the blades of your razor glide easily over the skin, protecting against shaving irritation. Shave without pressure. <br />Tip 3: After shaving, cool water not only removes hair debris and residual shaving gel, but also closes the pores of your skin, for a smooth finish.<br />Tip 4: Replace the blades of your Wilkinson Sword razor regularly (depending on your shaving routine). If you find your blade no longer glides easily over the skin, it's time to change. Dull blades cannot shave as thoroughly and are more likely to cause skin irritation as you push harder against your skin.","{'bc1': 'Toiletries & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Mens Toiletries', 'bc3': 'Razors & Blades', 'bc4': 'Razors'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/fdb880d8-abce-4a7a-a5df-ff65538a6f5c/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/wilkinson-sword-hydro-5-mens-razor-/108058669,8.5,male,none,male,male,black,0.4017508576836626,black,0.2632201585236011,teal,0.1504791198391104,True,,,,

1718,Sure Men Invisible Ice Fresh 48h Antiperspirant Deodorant 200ml,"Sure Men Invisible Ice Fresh Anti-Perspirant Aerosol Deodorant is formulated to provide 48 hour protection against sweat, odour and marks on your clothes, keeping black clothes black and white clothes white for longer. Its anti-white mark and yellow stain formula is dermatologically tested and alcohol free* so you can feel fresh, dry and protected all day long without worrying about irritation. This anti-perspirant deodorant for men contains Sure's innovative MotionSense technology which releases bursts of fresh and clean fragrance with a citrus kick when you need it most. It works like this: unique microcapsules sit on the surface of your skin. When you move, friction breaks those microcapsules releasing more fragrance. So, the more you move, the more it protects. That energising scent stays with you no matter how hard you push yourself. Because when you work hard, Sure works harder. Wear what you like. Move when you want. You know you're protected. Sure. It won't let you down. Have the confidence to move beyond your limits with Sure Invisible Ice Fresh anti-perspirant men's deodorant spray. Firstly, shake the can. Then hold it 15 centimetres away from your underarm and spray evenly in a well-ventilated area. Avoid contact with eyes and broken skin. This anti-perspirant deodorant is assembled in a factory using 100% renewable grid electricity. Made with infinitely recyclable aluminium, the compressed 200ml can is smaller but lasts just as long as its 250ml equivalent. Please recycle. Let's move together for a sustainable future. *ethyl alcohol","{'bc1': 'Health & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Deodorants', 'bc3': 'Antiperspirant', 'bc4': 'Mens Deodorant - Antiperspirant'}",https://digitalcontent.api.tesco.com/v2/media/ghs/a080779f-81ff-4853-a11d-4f327756982f/41a65749-ebec-4579-b690-41502f201f35_1479490195.jpeg?h=225&w=225,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/312841117,1.99,male,male,male,male,,,,,,,False,,,,

13270,The Ned Sauvignon Blanc 750ml,"Wine of Marlborough, New Zealand.
Certified vegan, NZVS.
The Ned Sauvignon Blanc displays punchy aromatics of lemon and lime citrus with undertones of juicy tropical fruits. Plush on the palate, showing juicy grapefruit freshness with lively acidity carrying these classical Waihopai Valley characters to a lengthy finish. You will not go amiss with flavours that complement the distinct varietal character in this Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc - a style that has a real sense of place. Think seafood and fresh harvested salads loaded with herbs. Try scallops sautÃ©ed in garlic butter with a slash of lemon, accompanied by a rocket and herb salad topped with fresh goatâs cheese. Crafted to be enjoyed at the peak of its vibrancy and freshness, we recommend drinking this wine within 2 - 3 years of vintage date.
Born of the Waihopai Valley, The Ned represents the vibrant diversity that is so prevalent in the Marlborough wine-growing region. One of Marlboroughâs famous peaks, The Ned mountain served as the playground for Marisco founder, Brent Marris, during his youth. The ethos âYoung At Heartâ encapsulates this wine; a true expression of grassroots winemaking that places the energy and liveliness of adventure in every bottle.","{'bc1': 'Groceries', 'bc2': 'Drinks', 'bc3': 'Wine'}",https://assets.sainsburys-groceries.co.uk/gol/8134256/image.jpg,https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/the-ned-sauvignon-blanc-750ml,10.75,none,male,none,male,black,0.28411166188364206,olive,0.2705452648056353,brown,0.19566918862509783,True,,,,

10549,Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey 1L,"Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 Tennessee Whiskey
Jack Daniel's & Cola is the way to enjoy this long-adored Tennessee Whiskey.
Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 is a premium Tennessee Whiskey. A warm amber colour with aromas of sweet vanilla, this is a smooth, full-bodied whiskey, with flavours of orange, brown sugar and spice, and a long rich finish. Jack Daniel registered his distillery in 1866, making it the oldest registered distillery in the United States. It's here in Lynchburg that every drop of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey is still produced and bottled today. During its 150 year history, Jack Daniel's has won numerous gold medals around the world. Its success can be put down to the unique way in which the famous 'Old No.7' brand is made, the same way it always has - using the finest corn, rye and barley malt; pure, iron-free water from the Cave Spring in the Distillery hollow; being mellowed through 10 feet of sugar maple charcoal; and aged in hand-crafted charred oak barrels. It is this unique way of making whiskey and the extra steps such as charcoal mellowing that makes Jack Daniel's what it is - a smooth sipping Tennessee whiskey and not a bourbon.
Aroma: Sweet, rich vanilla
Color: Warm amber
Taste: Full and Spicy; Smooth, full-bodied whiskey, with flavours of orange, brown sugar and spice
Finish: Full-bodied oak and dry apple
Jack Danielâs Tennessee Whiskey comes from the United States oldest registered distillery and is charcoal mellowed through 10 feet of sugar maple charcoal. The Distillery, founded in 1866 by Mr. Jack Daniel in Lynchburg, Tennessee, is one of the most well-known producers of whiskey in the world. Jack Danielâs Tennessee Whiskey is made with the finest corn, rye and barley malt. Its distinctive character is a result of natural fermentation, careful distillation, and use of the Distilleryâs iron-free water from the Cave Spring that runs at a constant 56Â° F.

10294,Jameson Triple Distilled Blended Irish Whiskey 1L,"Triple Distilled Irish Whiskey
Jameson Irish whiskey is a triple-distilled blended Irish whiskey, as versatile as it is smooth. Whiskey like Jameson isn't just born smooth and balanced. First, we take the best of pot still and fine grain whiskeys. Then we triple distil them. Not because we have to, because we want to. This gives Jameson its signature smoothness. This tradition began in 1780 with John Jameson, and we continue his legacy to this day. Finally, we age our whiskey in oak casks for a minimum of 4 years. The result? A unique whiskey with a perfect balance of spicy, nutty and vanilla notes with hints of sweet sherry. Simply enjoy neat, poured over ice, or in any of your favourite whiskey cocktails.
Winner of the 2018 The Irish Whiskey Masters (TIWM) Gold award
Tasting Notes
Colour: Rich, deep amber.
Nose: Jameson has a light floral fragrance, peppered with spicy wood and sweet notes.
Taste: Perfect balance of spicy, nutty and vanilla notes with hints of sweet sherry.
Finish: Exceptional smoothness.
We always like to say that everything you need to know about Jameson is right here - either on our bottle or in our bottle - encapsulating our full story. The label features our family crest and motto. Proclaiming âSine Metu', it means âWithout Fear'. It's the reason John Jameson first triple distilled Irish whiskey, creating Jameson Irish Whiskey as we know it. So in the spirit of Sine Metu, let us take you on a journey. Pull up a chairâ¦
Jameson bottles are made using up to 80% recycled glass and are 100% recyclable. The Midleton Distillery where Jameson is produced has reduced energy consumption by 30% since 2010, and water consumption by 33% since 2011.

Wine of South Eastern, Australia
Once tapped, stay good for 6 weeks
Bold stone fruit flavours with a creamy butter- Scotch finish
A taste you'll never forget
A liquid ode to our past, 19 Crimes is inspired by those who, beginning in 1788, were transported to Australia for a life of hard labour. Many did not survive the journey. For the sea-beaten people who made it ashore, a new world awaited.
As pioneers in a harsh frontier colony, they forged fresh pathways and built new lives from their chequered pasts, brick by brick.
This wine honours the history they wrote and the culture they built.

This full-bodied red is elegant and complex with richly concentrated notes of luscious plum and juicy black cherry. The intense fruit flavours are balanced by a fresh acidity and hints of spicy black pepper on the finish.
Calatayud is a rugged wine region within Aragon in north-eastern Spain and has a long history of growing Garnacha. This wine is made from grapes grown on old vines over 35 years old - the gnarly vines push their roots deep into the soil and produce fewer grapes with great concentration of flavour. Spanish wine expert Norrel Robertson MW has channelled his 20 years of winemaking experience into creating this richly complex red.

21265,St. Ives Blemish Control Apricot Face Scrub,"Only St. Ives captures the secrets of naturally beautiful and healthy looking skin in this deep cleansing formula that gently exfoliates, removing dull, dead skin cells. This delicious, yet simple facial scrub smells of fuzzy apricots, helps to exfoliate skin and deeply cleans pores for fresher than fresh skin.

Our Blemish Fighting Apricot Scrub contains salicylic acid to help prevent new blackheads & blemishes from forming. Made with 100% natural exfoliants for a gentle yet deep cleanse. Of course there's apricot extract too which is known to leave skin feeling soft and smooth.


-The Science of Exfoliation-
Did you know your skin is constantly renewing itself? Basically, your body is always making new skin cells: while you sleep, while you eat, during class or morning status meetings at work- you get the point! However, the process isnât perfect. Sometimes these old cells donât flake off quickly enough; this build-up can leave you with a rough, dull, tired-looking complexions. Enter the exfoliating face scrub! Used correctly, these deep facial cleansers can help boost radiance by gently buffing away leftover dead skin cells. Properly exfoliated skin looks fresher, smoother, and downright glowier.


-How to use-
1.	Squeeze a small size amount onto your fingertips and massage into damp skin. Spread in small circular motions, applying gentle pressure to wake your skinâs natural circulation.
2.	Work all over, right up to your hairline and onto the sides of your nose.
3.	When youâre done, rinse and pat dry with a clean towel. Use 3-4 times a week (depending on skin) for best results.

5904,"VonShef Cast Iron Griddle Pan 10"" Pre-Seasoned Non-Stick","Cast iron has been used as the cooking material of choice for hundreds of years. It comes up to temperature steadily and distributes heat evenly for optimum results. This square griddle pan is suitable for all types of heat source, including gas, electric, ceramic/halogen and induction hobs and can also be used in the oven as well as on open camp fires and barbecues. Made from pre-seasoned cast iron, the VonShef griddle pan is non-stick. The seasoning process involves baking vegetable oil on to the surface at a high temperature, creating a naturally non-stick surface, without the need for any chemical coating. You can easily maintain the surface by rubbing in a little fresh oil after washing in soap and water. The raised griddle surface allows any fat to drain away and the lip on the side of the pan enables easy disposal of cooking liquids.","{'bc1': 'Marketplace', 'bc2': 'Cook & Dine', 'bc3': 'Cookware', 'bc4': 'Pots & Pans'}",https://digitalcontent.api.tesco.com/v2/media/marketplace/baadc38e-e72b-47f9-9f7a-be20109890c7/VhTeTOBqwF-RCEaCX21FZt1Ts_822662809.jpeg?h=225&w=225,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/325340969,21.99,none,none,none,none,,,,,,,False,,,,

TASTING NOTES - The sweetest meeting of fine Irish whiskey, Irish dairy cream, rich chocolate and vanilla flavours
HOW TO ENJOY - Great on its own, served over ice cream for a sophisticated twist, or even in your favourite treats such as Chocolate Mousse, Hot Chocolate or Iced Coffee!
BAILEYS IS B CORP CERTIFIED - The B Corp movement is focused on transforming the global economy to benefit all people, communities, and the planet, building a more resilient and sustainable future for all
Baileys is the World's Number 1 Irish Cream Liqueur around the globe*. With its distinct velvety texture, it is a perfect combination of smooth cream and Irish whiskey. Enjoy on its own, over ice or in your favourite coffee. And if you are looking for more ways to indulge, from gooey Baileys Irish Cream Cheesecake to classy Baileys Espresso Martini, Baileys recipes hit the sweet spot every time. Drawing on Irish traditions in dairy and distilling, the unique combination took four years to perfect the ultimate liquid treat.
Once upon a time, a small, let's say, determined group had a brilliant but lofty idea where they tried to have their cake and eat it too. You see, our founders wanted to take two simple treasures that their country was known for, delicious dairy cream and world-renowned Irish whiskey, and combine them. It took two years of trial and error but by 1974 we had added the finest spirits, rich chocolate and vanilla flavours (with some other flavours and ingredients) along with a little magic, to create the Baileys recipe we now know and love. And if you are looking for more ways to indulge, from gooey Baileys Irish Cream Cheesecake to classy Baileys Espresso Martini and Hot Chocolate, Baileys recipes hit the sweet spot every time.","{'bc1': 'Groceries', 'bc2': 'Drinks', 'bc3': 'Spirits & liqueurs'}",https://assets.sainsburys-groceries.co.uk/gol/2076355/image.jpg,https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/baileys-original-irish-cream-liqueur-1l,21.95,none,none,none,none,black,0.25131027253668764,tan,0.18343815513626835,brown,0.17636268343815514,True,,,,

Cockburn's was founded in 1815 in Oporto by Robert Cockburn, a Scottish wine merchant from a distinguished family in Edinburgh. Today, Cockburn's is the number 1 Port brand in the UK.
Originally introduced in 1969, Cockburnâs Special Reserve bridged the gap between vintage ports and their younger counterparts, creating an approachable yet complex new port category. Today, it is the number 1 selling port wine in the UK.
Rich and concentrated red fruit aromas with bright red cherry and hints of plum and strawberry. Sweet and well-rounded, luscious red berry flavours lead to a distinctive peppery and slightly dry finish.
Savour this wine in a large wine glass at room temperature, or slightly chilled in warm weather to appreciate its power and depth. Perfect served at the end of a meal or during your favourite Netflix special. Does not need to be decanted. Consume within four to six weeks of opening. Special Reserve pairs perfectly with cheeses or rich, nutty, or chocolate desserts.
