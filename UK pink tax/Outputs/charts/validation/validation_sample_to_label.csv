You can feel fresh, dry and protected all-day long and your garments will stay as protected as you are. After all, surely the best fashion accessory is no sweat or deodorant spray stains. The unbeatable anti-sweat Microtechnology provides 2x more powerful protection*, so you're always ready for whatever your day throws at you. Our innovative MotionSense technology releases bursts of fresh, airy fragrance when you need it most. It works like this: unique microcapsules sit on the surface of your skin. When you move, friction breaks those microcapsules releasing more fragrance. So, the more you move, the more it protects. That fresh scent stays with you no matter how hard you push yourself. Because when you work hard, Sure works harder. Sure. It won't let you down. Get all-day freshness and 72-hour non-stop protection that works in sync with your body for non-stop confidence from morning to night. Wear what you like. Move when you want. You know you're protected. How to use: Firstly, shake the anti-perspirant women's deodorant spray can. Then hold it 15 centimetres away from your underarm and spray evenly in a well-ventilated area.

This change in appearance in no way impacts the quality, effectiveness or stability of Centrum, it‚Äôs the same high-quality product that Centrum is known for. *Based on worldwide sales of the Centrum range.

 Top Tips for House Training<br />Puppies can take up to 6 months to house train, and some breeds, a little longer. Even with great progress, there could well be the odd 'mistake' sometimes! Don't worry - stay focussed and follow these tips to help you on the way to success!<br />1. Unfold the pad and place on the floor with the plastic backing part down against the floor. Make sure the pad is placed away from their food and bed.<br />2. Place your puppy on the pad to get them used to standing on it; and look out for any signs they may need to go to the toilet, such as sniffing the floor, trying to squat down or circling. Place your puppy on the pad as soon as you notice any of these signs.<br />3. As soon as your puppy uses the pad to go to the toilets, praise and reward them. If the puppy tries to relieve themselves somewhere else, place them straight onto the pad again to get them to associate the pad with using it for toileting.<br />4. Discard any soiled pads and replace with a fresh, clean one straight away.<br />5. As training develops, the pad can be moved towards the door and then eventually placed just outside in a suitable area.<br /><br />Remember:<br />Reward the pup for going to the toilet in the right place, Good Boy have a great range of suitable treats!<br />Never punish your puppy for house training 'mistakes'. Always be positive and happy; and give your pup confidence.<br />Put your puppy on a regular feeding routine to give them structure for eating and toilet times.<br />Keep a training diary - it will help in working out timings for feeding and toileting as your pup grows up.","{'bc1': 'Pet Shop', 'bc2': 'Dog & Puppy', 'bc3': 'Dog Care, Toys & Accessories', 'bc4': 'Accessories'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/afdfb443-b481-47d5-a3f1-772f5fac508e/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/good-boy-puppy-training-pads-dog-accessories/110356024,none,pink,lavender,TRUE,,

Once upon a time, a small, let's say, determined group had a brilliant but lofty idea where they tried to have their cake and eat it too. You see, our founders wanted to take two simple treasures that their country was known for, delicious dairy cream and world-renowned Irish whiskey, and combine them. It took two years of trial and error but by 1974 we had added the finest spirits, rich chocolate and vanilla flavours (with some other flavours and ingredients) along with a little magic, to create the Baileys recipe we now know and love. And if you are looking for more ways to indulge, from gooey Baileys Irish Cream Cheesecake to classy Baileys Espresso Martini and Hot Chocolate, Baileys recipes hit the sweet spot every time.","{'bc1': 'Groceries', 'bc2': 'Drinks', 'bc3': 'Spirits & liqueurs'}",https://assets.sainsburys-groceries.co.uk/gol/8162021/image.jpg,https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/baileys-espresso-cr%C3%A8me-liqueur-50cl,none,black,gray,TRUE,,

preparationAndUsage
 Before you use this condom, check the expiry date on the condom wrapper. If the individual container is obviously damaged, throw that one away and use a new one from an undamaged package. Put a condom on before the penis touches the other person. This helps to prevent pregnancy and the possibility of catching sexually transmitted infections during vaginal, anal or oral sex.<br /><br />1. Tear the wrapper open from the serrated edge. Be careful with the condom, it could get damaged by fingernails or sharp objects.<br />2. With the roll outside, squeeze the teat and place the condom on the tip of the erect penis.<br />3. Roll down to the base. If the condom doesn't unroll, it may be on backwards, discard and use a new one. Stop and check if you feel the condom slipping off or too tight on the penis because this might lead to breakage. You should take the condom off soon after ejaculation. Hold the condom firmly at the base of the penis before pulling out.<br />4. Throw the foil and used condom into a bin. Don't flush down the toilet.","{'bc1': 'Health, Wellbeing & Medicines', 'bc2': 'Family Planning & Sexual Health', 'bc3': 'Condoms'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/e5f537ce-7826-42c9-95a9-e2b095e531ed/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/durex-thin-feel-extra-lubricated-condoms/111003386,none,brown,brown,TRUE,,

When the scalp is dry, skin has low ceramides - the natural lipids normally found in skin that help hold cells together and prevent moisture loss. Head & Shoulders DermaXPro Soothing Comfort Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, infused with aloe vera extract and ceramide complex (Piroctone Olamine + ceramide), works on the scalp surface to help restore ceramide levels and repair skin dryness. It is designed especially for itchy*, unbalanced scalps and is clinically proven to restore skin ceramides and reduce scalp itchiness*. The result? A moisturised, soothed and flake-free** scalp, leaving you to unleash your best hair yet.
