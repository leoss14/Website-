That's why Centrum Advance 50 + multivitamin has adjusted levels of key nutrients to offer specific nutritional support to adults over 50. These multivitamin tablets for women and men support your energy levels, helping you to keep up with your busy life. The formula includes vitamin B12 which contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism, vitamin C to maintain the normal function of the immune system, and vitamin D to help maintain normal healthy teeth and bones. You can trust Centrum Advance 50+ multivitamins to help fulfil the nutritional needs of men and women over the age of 50. Packaging and tablet colour may vary slightly.

 Quality skincare every day<br />We understand the importance of quality everyday products that care for skin with minimal fuss.<br /><br />For 70 years, E45 has been a skincare expert in dry and itchy skin and treatment for eczema, psoriasis, ichthyosis and other dry skin conditions. It has proven dermatological expertise thatâs dedicated to vulnerable dry skin.<br /><br />The E45 range of skincare products has been developed for different skin types and different parts of the body. It works hard to protect and maintain skin health, while E45 Cream and E45 Itch Relief Cream can also improve dry skin health at every application.<br /><br />The voice of experience<br />In 1952 we released our first product â E45 cream. It was created by a Boots chemist in response to a customer request for a product that would soothe and protect the skin.<br /><br />In 1963 physicians noticed E45 cream was a beneficial treatment for dry skin conditions. At this time, we only promoted our products to hospital sales departments. It wasnât until 1980 that E45 cream was introduced to the pharmacy and retail establishments, where it was recognised for its efficacy in the treatment of dry skin.<br /><br />In the 1990s we extended our product range to include a complete skincare emollient therapy. Weâve continued to create products with patients and their skin in mind. We strive to continue to serve the needs of both patients and healthcare professionals and produce better treatment options for patientsâ skincare routines.

 EFFECTIVE HYDRATION â E45âs Daily Lotion offers effective, everyday hydration. As skin gets drier, it feels and looks less healthy and becomes less effective at retaining moisture, which leaves it even more dry. Our lotion soothes, protects, and restores very dry skin â it intensely replenishes moisture to sooth dryness and smooth out rough skin. The lotion locks in moisture to help better protect the skin against moisture loss, and to help restore and maintain the skinâs moisture level., MOISTURISING INGREDIENTS â Our Daily Lotion contains light liquid paraffin that has emollient moisturising properties to help keep the skin hydrated. The perfume-free gentle formula is non-greasy and quickly absorbed and is even suitable for sensitive skin. The lightweight lotion is easy to apply to skin and can be used whenever the skin feels dry, locking in moisture and leaving you with long-lasting softness in just 2 weeks., DERMATOLOGICALLY TESTED â E45âs formulation is dermatologically tested and does not contain any unnecessary colour or fragrances. It is suitable for everyday use on dry and sensitive skin for the whole family, including infants over the age of 1 month. You can apply the lightweight lotion all over the body, including the face, for soft and supple skin. The lotion has a low viscosity with watery consistency which can be thoroughly applied on the skin and is easily absorbed., QUALITY SKINCARE EVERY DAY â For 60 years, E45 has been a skincare expert in dry and itchy skin and treatment for eczema, psoriasis, ichthyosis and other dry skin conditions. We understand the importance of quality everyday products that care for your skin with minimal fuss. The E45 range of products has been developed for different skin types and parts of the body and works hard to protect and maintain skin health. It has proven dermatological expertise dedicated to vulnerable dry skin., FOR BEST RESULTS: Use with E45 cleansing products such as E45 Shower Cream and E45 Wash Cream to ensure end to end emollient therapy.

The rich, reddish colour of PIMM'S No.1 Cup, with its subtle taste of spice and citrus, was brought to life in 1840. The secret recipe of gin, herbs, and liqueur was mixed by James Pimm in his London Oyster Bar to aid the digestion of oysters. It was not only sent to soldiers at the very edge of the Empire, but was also served at Queen Victoria's luncheons. Last but not least, the PIMM'S No. 1 Cup is known as the classic drink to accompany the famous Wimbledon tennis tournament and can still be found at many legendary cultural events. After all, PIMM'S is the signpost to summer!

preparationAndUsage
 Before using Veet Wax Strips, please read pack precautions carefully.<br />Make sure the skin is completely clean and dry before waxing and you can reuse each strip more than once until it loses its stickiness<br />No need to rub the strips between the hands to separate them!<br />You can achieve great results in just 4 easy steps:<br />1 Slowly peel the strips apart using the outwards rounded tabs.<br />2 On Bikini: bend your leg outwards. Place a strip on your skin and rub repeatedly in the direction of hair growth.<br />On Underarm: hair tends to grow in two different directions: the upper part upwards, and the lower part downwards, so make sure you wax this area in 2 stages. Put one hand behind your head and stretch your arm back to hold your skin taut, lift the elbow up and well back to tighten the skin. Place a strip onto one half of the underarm and rub repeatedly in the direction of hair growth (away from the centre of underarm).<br />3 Hold tab. Hold skin taut. Pull strip back on itself as fast as you can in one swift motion, close to the skin, as you pull.<br />4 After waxing, clean away any wax left on you skin with a Perfect Finish Wipe.","{'bc1': 'Toiletries & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Shaving & Hair Removal', 'bc3': 'Womens Waxing'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/673730c0-2a6a-421f-8490-4e74a30923c0/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/veet-wax-strips-with-easy-gel-sensitive-skin-bikini--underarm-/111885892,13,female,female,none,female,,,

preparationAndUsage
 Tip 1: Warm water softens thick and stubborn hairs and allows for more of the hair to be exposed from beneath the skin. Wash your face thoroughly for about two to three minutes before shaving for an optimal result. <br />Tip 2: For a particularly close shave, use shaving gel or soap. This also ensures that the blades of your razor glide easily over the skin, protecting against shaving irritation. Shave without pressure. <br />Tip 3: After shaving, cool water not only removes hair debris and residual shaving gel, but also closes the pores of your skin, for a smooth finish.<br />Tip 4: Replace the blades of your Wilkinson Sword razor regularly (depending on your shaving routine). If you find your blade no longer glides easily over the skin, it's time to change. Dull blades cannot shave as thoroughly and are more likely to cause skin irritation as you push harder against your skin.","{'bc1': 'Toiletries & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Mens Toiletries', 'bc3': 'Razors & Blades', 'bc4': 'Blades'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/5c953cc2-819b-40d7-9479-5d965702e7a7/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/wilkinson-sword-hydro-5-mens-razor-blades/108058757,11.5,male,male,male,male,,,

When you are dealing with excessive sweating, you want highly effective and reliable protection that is kind to your skin. This anti-perspirant cream stick is 3x more powerful* on sweat thanks to our active technology and our TRIsolid cream formula is body responsive with a unique blend of skin-moisturising ingredients, so itâs gentle enough for everyday use. Sureâs most powerful strong deodorant forms a protective layer across your sweat glands, tackling odour from the source. With Sure's innovative MotionSense technology that releases bursts of clean, fresh fragrance, you get total confidence to keep going whatever life throws at you. It works like this: unique microcapsules sit on the surface of your skin. When you move, friction breaks those microcapsules releasing more fragrance. So, the more you move, the more it protects. How to use: Sure Maximum Protection anti-perspirant women's deodorant stick can be used in the morning or at night. For optimum sweat protection, apply at night when your sweat glands are less active. Twist the bottom to release the cream with two clicks per underarm and smooth onto each underarm evenly. Sure gives you all the backup you need.

2034,Impulse O2 Lemon & Freesia Body Spray 75Ml,"Get a flashback to the 90s, with this iconic fragrance blend of lemon and freesia. The original fragrance first created in the 90s is back by popular demand, embodying everything about the decade you loved - from roller skates to cassettes - in one sentimental female body spray. A long-lasting body spray for ladies. To apply, hold can 15cm away from the body, spray and feel revitalised. The 75ml fragrance fits perfectly in your handbag for a little dose of inspo on the go. Opening with refreshing citrus, splashed with fresh green notes, enveloped by elegant jasmine and freesia and underscored by amber, musk and cedarwood, O2 is a fresh yet delicate feminine fragrance. A graceful and light-hearted mix of ingredients to create that same iconic 90s fragrance. With lemon and freesia combined with a musk scent, O2 has lost none of its uplifting retro feel. From the number 1 female body spray brand in the UK that gave you Impulse Very Pink and Impulse Hint of Musk, this retro Impulse spray won't disappoint. Gentle, affordable and worth the wait! Fancy a trip down memory lane? You asked us to #BringBack90sImpulse and we have heard your cries. The wait is finally up - the Impulse O2 body spray is back! The nostalgic fragrance that saw us through countless school discos, netball matches and at least one notorious 90s party is here to add some spontaneity, boldness and fun to your everyday. A unique blend of lemon, freesia and ace of base. That's right, the refreshing fragrance of O2 has returned to provide a long-awaited splash of retro spirit. This vintage Impulse body spray will not just deliver an olfactory sensation, it will envelop every one of your senses in a wave of nostalgia, bringing you right back to the decade of flip phones, slap bands and sneaking out through the window.

 Beautifully Smooth Skin in Just 3 Steps<br />Before using, please read pack precautions carefully. <br />1 Using the curved part of the spatula, spread the Veet Cream evenly to fully coat the hair.<br />2 Leave the cream on your skin for 5 minutes, and then use the spatula to gently remove a small test area of cream. If the hair comes away easily, use the wider or narrower end of the spatula depending on the body part, to remove the rest. If your hair is more stubborn, you can leave the cream on for up to 10 minutes in total - but don't leave it any longer.<br />3 Rinse your skin thoroughly with water to remove the cream completely, and then dry.","{'bc1': 'Toiletries & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Shaving & Hair Removal', 'bc3': 'Womens Shaving Creams'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/491ee911-9f95-4c52-b944-a60cd9672a02/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/veet-pure-hair-removal-cream-body--legs-for-sensitive-skin/100667401,5.5,female,none,none,female,,,

9257,Sure 72h Uplifting & Fresh Roll-On Antiperspirant Deodorant 50ml,"Next level moves demand next level sweat protection. Thatâs why Sure Women Nonstop Uplifting & Fresh Anti-Perspirant Roll On Deodorant is designed to provide 72 hour nonstop protection against sweat and odour, so youâre always ready to keep going. Its alcohol-free** formula helps you feel fresh, dry and protected all day long without causing irritation. The unbeatable anti-sweat Microtechnology provides 2x more powerful protection* while our innovative MotionSense technology releases bursts of uplifting fragrance when you need it most. It works like this: unique microcapsules sit on the surface of your skin. When you move, friction breaks those microcapsules releasing more fragrance. So, the more you move, the more it protects. That fresh scent stays with you no matter how hard you push yourself. Because when you work hard, Sure works harder. Sure. It wonât let you down. Grab Sure Uplifting & Fresh antiperspirant deodorant for women to get all day freshness and 72 hour protection that works in sync with your body for nonstop confidence from morning to night. Before applying, ensure your underarms are dry. Roll on in circular motions, checking coverage is even on both underarms. Avoid contact with eyes and broken skin.
