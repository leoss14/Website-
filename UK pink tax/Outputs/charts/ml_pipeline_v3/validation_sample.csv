preparationAndUsage
 Takes from 5 - 10 minutes<br />Beautifully smooth skin in just 5 Steps<br />Before using, please read pack precautions carefully.<br />1 Before you shower, use the soft, coloured side of the sponge to apply the cream evenly onto dry skin. Don't rub it in. Make sure the hair you want to remove is completely covered. Don't forget to wash any cream off your hands.<br />2 Wait at least 2 minutes before stepping into the shower.<br />3 Now continue with your normal shower routine. For the first 3 minutes, try to avoid putting the cream directly in the stream of water, so that it stays on long enough to work. It is usual for some cream to gradually wash away at this stage.<br />4 Now that the cream has been on your skin for 5 minutes in total, use the white side of the sponge to gently remove a small test area of cream. If the hair comes away easily, massage the sponge in a circular motion to remove the rest. If your hair is more stubborn, you can leave the cream on for up to 5 more minutes - but not any longer, as you don't want to exceed a total of 10 minutes with the cream on your skin. For more sensitive areas use the soft, coloured side of the sponge to remove the cream.<br />5 Rinse your skin thoroughly with water to remove the cream completely, and then dry. Rinse the sponge, and keep the tube closed when not in use to make sure the cream stays effective.","{'bc1': 'Toiletries & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Shaving & Hair Removal', 'bc3': 'Womens Razors & Blades'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/c80fef5f-168a-4d2f-bc1d-0df88d2c94bd/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/veet-in-shower-hair-removal-cream-body--legs-for-sensitive-skin/106455978,8.5,female,female,0.6595723668396172,0.2611371939846989,0.07929043917568393,0.6595723668396172,,,

3068,260598809,Vaseline Intensive Care Aloe Lotion200ml,"Vaseline Intensive Care Aloe Soothe Body Lotion combines healing micro-droplets of Vaseline Jelly with aloe vera, known to calm and soothe the skin. The result is a refreshing, fast-absorbing lotion that reduces the discomfort associated with dry, irritated skin, and leaves it feeling deeply moisturised and rejuvenated. Our Intensive Care Aloe Soothe Body Lotion is clinically proven to moisturise deeply* to soothe dry skin with the first application, and to keep it restored for 3 weeks**. Our skin is the barrier between our bodies and the outside world, and the health of our skin is essential to our overall well-being. At Vaseline, we believe that healthy skin starts with deep-restoring moisture, which is why our lotion's formula works to heal and soothe dry skin. The micro-droplets of Vaseline Jelly penetrate deep down within the stratum corneum to lock in moisture and form a protective layer on your skin. This sealing barrier speeds up the skinâs natural recovery process. Apply Vaseline Intensive Care Aloe Soothe Body Lotion daily, letting its rich yet quick-absorbing formula provide intense moisturisation to your skin and leave it delicately fragranced with a fresh aloe vera scent. *based on 4-week treatment clinical study **within the stratum corneum","{'bc1': 'Health & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Body Skincare', 'bc3': 'Body Moisturiser', 'bc4': 'Dry Skin Body Moisturiser'}",https://digitalcontent.api.tesco.com/v2/media/ghs/ddc3a4c7-98cd-4e9e-b1f9-8841a251a0b7/0f842376-38e5-4c0b-8d02-0cf59c7761f5_1427825642.jpeg?h=225&w=225,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/260598809,3.65,none,female,0.4466005814592546,0.33543359633096886,0.21796582220977653,0.4466005814592546,,,

furtherDescription
 Straw cups are great alternatives to sippy cups, with a soft straw helping to develop sipping skills. The soft, silicone straw is easy to drink through and little ones donât have to tip the cup up very far to drink from it. This straw cup encourages sipping which supports speech and healthy oral development by building lip, cheek and tongue strength. Featuring INTELLIVALVE, a unique anti-leak technology which guarantees this drinking bottle is completely leak-proof as it withstands internal pressure meaning the bottle wonât leak even when it is turned upside down or shaken. Our unique valve both seals and regulates the flow of liquid to stop leaks and to ensure easy drinking. With hygiene at the forefront of everyoneâs minds our drinking bottles add an extra layer of reassurance as the drinking spout contains BACSHIELD antibacterial technology. BACSHIELD is a commonly used silver-ion technology that provides antibacterial product protection against unwanted bacteria, recognised for centuries with no harmful effects. It works by preventing the growth of unwanted bacteria that can cause product degradation, discolouration, staining or odour. This is achieved with silver ions mixed in the material on the straw*, preventing bacteria from multiplying. All our products are BPA, BPS, PVC, Phthalate and Nitrosamine free. *Independent laboratory testing demonstrated a 99.9% reduction in bacteria after 24 hours. **The semisoft part of the straw contains silver phosphate glass, tested to ISO 22196 standards.

4015,325085149,Rink Drink Champagne Saucers - 200ml - Clear - Pack of 6,"Serve Champagne, Sparkling Wine and Cocktails in iconic vintage style with this pack of 6 Glass Champagne Saucers from Rink Drink. Said to have been modelled on the - ahem - assets of Madame de Pompadour, the chief mistress of King Louis XV of France, the Champagne Coupe was, in fact, designed in the United Kingdom in the mid-17th Century. Perhaps its greatest association, however, is within the Art Deco stylings of 1920s and 30s America, thanks largely to the high popularity of films like The Great Gatsby. While the striking style of these glasses is obvious, the iconic silhouette has its practical benefits, too - the large surface area provided by the wide bowl maximises the amount of fragrance and aroma to come forth from your beverage. This has led to the popularity of the Coupe extending far beyond the traditional champagne and into the world of cocktails, where one can often find it as the vessel of choice for Sidecars, Daquiris and more. Whether shopping for business or for pleasure, for a retro-themed party or a trendy wine bar, these Vintage Glass Champagne Saucers from Rink Drink are sure to stand out in a crowd.","{'bc1': 'Marketplace', 'bc2': 'Cook & Dine', 'bc3': 'Glassware', 'bc4': 'Champagne Flutes & Saucers'}",https://digitalcontent.api.tesco.com/v2/media/marketplace/04f90c97-f414-4178-b335-af6c029a59c1/KgERkm9Xfus_5LAe9McE9ksjs_1551476602.jpeg?h=225&w=225,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/325085149,15.99,none,none,0.11278674565815877,0.11944626126723869,0.7677669930746026,0.7677669930746026,,,

preparationAndUsage
 Preparing the feed<br />Please follow preparation and feeding instructions carefully; failure to do so may make your baby ill, as powdered milks are not sterile.<br />1 Wash hands and sterilise all equipment following the manufacturers' instructions<br />2 Boil 1 litre of freshly run water and leave to cool for no longer than 30 minutes. Do not use artificially softened or repeatedly boiled water.<br />3 Measure the required amount of water into a sterilised bottle (referring to the feeding guide).<br />4 Using the scoop provided, add the correct number of scoops of powder - 1 level scoop of powder to each fluid ounce of water (approx. 30ml). Level off the powder using the scoop leveller. Do not press the powder.<br />5 Place the sterilised teat and cap on the bottle and shake well until all the powder has dissolved (approx. 15 seconds).<br />6 Cool to drinking temperature (approx. 37Â°C) by holding the bottle under cold running water, and feed immediately. Always test the temperature of the milk before feeding.<br /><br />Feeding guide (1 scoop = approx. 4.5g powder)<br />Amount of cooled, boiled water per feed: 5fl oz, 150ml; Number of level scoops of powder per feed: 5 scoops<br />Amount of cooled, boiled water per feed: 6fl oz, 180ml; Number of level scoops of powder per feed: 6 scoops<br /><br />Babies from 6 months onwards need about 500 ml - 600 ml of HiPP Organic follow on milk per day, either as a drink, on cereals or added to other foods. However, this is only a guide and your baby may need more or less than this. If you require more advice, please consult your health professional.<br /><br />Feeding information<br />- Only use the scoop provided in the pack.<br />- Do not make feeds weaker or stronger than indicated by adding extra water/scoops, and do not add anything else to milk feeds.<br />- For hygiene reasons, always freshly prepare feeds and do not prepare in advance.<br />- Use made-up feeds immediately, and discard anything left over at the end of the feed.<br />- Do not heat feeds in a microwave - hot spots may occur which could cause scalding.<br />- A responsible person should be with your baby during feeding.<br />- Please clean your baby's teeth regularly when they appear.<br />- Introduce a cup or beaker as soon as possible to prevent prolonged/frequent contact of teeth with milk feeds which may increase the risk of tooth decay.
