This anti-perspirant men's deodorant contains Sure's innovative MotionSense technology which releases bursts of fresh, invigorating fragrance with citrusy, spicy and woody notes when you need it most. It works like this: unique microcapsules sit on the surface of your skin. When you move, friction breaks those microcapsules releasing more fragrance. So, the more you move, the more it protects. That energising scent stays with you no matter how hard you push yourself. Because when you work hard, Sure works harder. Sure. It won't let you down. Have the confidence to move beyond your limits with Quantum Dry anti-perspirant deodorant spray. Firstly, shake the can. Then hold it 15 centimetres away from your underarm and spray evenly in a well-ventilated area. Avoid contact with eyes and broken skin. This anti-perspirant deodorant is assembled in a factory using 100% renewable grid electricity. Made with infinitely recyclable aluminium, the compressed 200ml can is smaller but lasts just as long as its 250ml equivalent. Please recycle.

A true home away from home for when on the go. -Are you a big Disney fan? And did you love Winnie the Pooh as a child? Then pass your enthusiasm on to your child easily with this beautiful travel cot in a timeless design. -If you like things uncomplicated, you will love the Dream N Play Go. It can be assembled and disassembled in a few simple steps. And thanks to the wheels, you can also simply slide it into another room. -When on the go, you often have little space. That's why we've made it possible for you to fold the travel cot together and pack it in the corresponding bag. Thanks to the wheels, for which the bag has slots, it can be easily moved. Our hint for an easy assembly! Put up the folded bed on its feet and pull it apart. First unfold the short side parts and then the large ones until they properly engage. Only then push the middle of the floor and then the whole floor down until it reaches a flat and stable position. When folding the bed, do the opposite. First pull up the floor and only then unbar the short and then the large side parts.

Fresh tropical fruit notes blend with peach and apricot and finished with crisp apple. It is made in a fresh, modern style whilst retaining the delicious creamy texture that is typical of Australian Chardonnays.
It is produced by ChÃ¢teau Tanunda, which was established in 1890 and is one of Australia's iconic wineries. Today it is family owned with tradition of fine winemaking spanning three centuries, and expertise that allows them to continue to create great tasting wines.
A delight with hot smoked salmon.","{'bc1': 'Groceries', 'bc2': 'Drinks', 'bc3': 'Wine'}",https://assets.sainsburys-groceries.co.uk/gol/7832140/image.jpg,https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-australian-barossa-chardonnay--taste-the-difference-75cl,8.75,none,none,male,0.09314415953220845,0.8137116809355831,male,,,

 Have you tried our other tempting truffle recipes?<br />Vanilla Truffles<br />Salted Caramel Truffles<br /><br />Like most people my fondest childhood memories are sprinkled with sunny days, smiling faces and chocolate! But chocolate became an all-consuming passion in 1992 when I discovered the art of chocolate making. From the beginning it was all about amazing taste, delicious ingredients and creating mouth watering recipes to share with family and friends... and from there the seed of a business, Lily O'Brien's, began to grow.

preparationAndUsage
 Tip 1: Warm water softens thick and stubborn hairs and allows for more of the hair to be exposed from beneath the skin. Wash your face thoroughly for about two to three minutes before shaving for an optimal result. <br />Tip 2: For a particularly close shave, use shaving gel or soap. This also ensures that the blades of your razor glide easily over the skin, protecting against shaving irritation. Shave without pressure. <br />Tip 3: After shaving, cool water not only removes hair debris and residual shaving gel, but also closes the pores of your skin, for a smooth finish.<br />Tip 4: Replace the blades of your Wilkinson Sword razor regularly (depending on your shaving routine). If you find your blade no longer glides easily over the skin, it's time to change. Dull blades cannot shave as thoroughly and are more likely to cause skin irritation as you push harder against your skin.","{'bc1': 'Toiletries & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Mens Toiletries', 'bc3': 'Razors & Blades', 'bc4': 'Blades'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/90a812d7-e1c0-49ae-a417-3c8a194fe16e/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/wilkinson-sword-hydro-3-skin-protection-razor-blades/113289058,9.3,male,male,male,0.03673564725116545,0.9265287054976691,male,,,

21150,Vaseline Original Pure Petroleum Jelly,"Vaseline Original Petroleum Jelly is the original skin protectant that's been used to protect and help heal dry skin since 1870. Our skin is the barrier between our bodies and the outside world, and the health of our skin is essential to our overall well-being. At Vaseline, we believe that healthy skin starts with deep-restoring moisture, which is why our jelly's formula works to calm and soothe dry, damaged skin. The triple-purification seal guarantees each jar of Vaseline Jelly has been purified not once but three times. Fragrance-free, hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic, Vaseline Original is non-irritating and suitable for a multitude of uses â it acts as a dry skin moisturiser, as a lip balm, or even as a baby cream. Our Petroleum Jelly is dermatologically tested and appropriate for use on sensitive and eczema-prone skin. Unlike some topical lotions and creams, Vaseline Jelly penetrates into the surface layers of the skin to seal in moisture, thereby assisting the skin's natural recovery process. This can visibly rejuvenate dry skin and help reduce the appearance of fine, dry lines. Vaseline Original Jelly creates a protective barrier that shields the skin against environmental factors such as windburn, and has been used for over 100 years to protect minor cuts, scrapes, and burns.
Made with triple-purified Petroleum Jelly, Vaseline Original protects dry, cracked skin and locks in moisture to keep it healthy. Vaseline Petroleum Jelly is clinically proven to help heal dry or damaged skin. The original wonder jelly can be used on dry skin, stressed skin, and sensitive skin to protect it from windburn or chapping. Vaseline provides dry skin relief and helps protect minor cuts, scrapes and burns. Petroleum Jelly is hypoallergenic, dermatologically tested and non-comedogenic, so it will not clog your pores. Vaseline cares for the skin you're born in, which is why our Petroleum Jelly works deep to moisturise dry, rough, and irritated skin.","{'bc1': 'Toiletries & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Skin Care', 'bc3': 'Hands', 'bc4': 'Lips & Foot Care', 'bc5': 'Lip Balms'}",https://ui.assets-asda.com:443/dm/42182634,https://groceries.asda.com/product/hands-lips--foot-care/vaseline-original-pure-petroleum-jelly/19635,2.5,none,none,female,0.5768180771692994,0.1536361543385989,female,,,

When breast feeding is not possible, this bottle may be used to give expressed breast milk or prepared infant formula to your baby. Make up the feed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use cooled freshly boiled water for feed preparation. NEVER HEAT A SEALED BOTTLE IN A MICROWAVE OVEN.

3620,VonShef Black Cast Iron Japanese Teapot with Infuser 800ml,"Add a touch of culture to your tea-making with the beautiful teapot - perfect for any discerning tea lover. Cast iron is renowned for its ability to evenly distribute heat for a more flavourful cup of tea. Featuring a mesh infuser insert, it gives you the freedom to brew your favourite loose tea or use tea bags. Traditional hobnail effect and over-arching handle creates an elegant addition to any table top. During the 17th and 18th centuries, cast iron tea pots were placed over an open charcoal fire to keep water warm, which was believed to slowly release iron into the water, providing drinkers with a dietary source.

Developed using skincare research recognised by the British Skin Foundation, these laundry capsules are dermatologically tested and suitable for the whole family. They are Persilâs fastest-dissolving capsule, even in quick and cold washes, so you can use them in the most energy-efficient programmes without worrying about residue. How to use: Use 1 capsule for standard soiling and soft/medium water (3â5 kg load). Use 2 capsules for heavy soiling and hard water or a larger (6â8 kg) load. Pop the capsule(s) at the back of the drum before adding your laundry. Do not overload your machine. If ever your capsule leaves a little residue on your clothes, simply rinse under warm water. Do not use a pre-wash. Store away from heat, moisture and sunlight. This product contains a bittering agent on its surface to help prevent accidental ingestion by children. Wash your hands after handling the capsule. At Persil, we believe that dirt is part of the game. Sweat, blood and mud will always be there, but so will we. The first time and every time. Picking you up, dusting you down and sending you back fresh and ready again. So, leave your mark on the field. Play on.

13672,Greasy Fingers Big Buttery Chardonnay 750ml,"Wine of Australia
A perfect gift at any occasion for foodies or treat for yourself - go on, we won't judge
For your indulgence - an utterly decadent drop. Made to be the perfect accompaniment to that greasy fingers moment. This classic Chardonnay delivers full flavour that will match any burger, from the first sip to the last bite.
Greasy Fingers Chardonnay is a generous and flavoursome Aussie favourite. Pale straw in colour, with an aroma of warmed peaches, vanilla custard and cinnamon spice. A generous palate of peach crumble, toasted marshmallow and smoky bacon.
Serve chilled with a grilled portobello mushroom burger with provolone cheese. Or goes just as well with fluffy pancakes topped with caramelised banana, maple syrup and bacon.
Greasy Fingers makes wine for the food you love. Not the lightly-drizzled, calorie-reduced, flavour-compromised stuff. Itâs a vino without vanity, a bold, screw-topped bottle of attitude. Our fuss-free wines have been expertly crafted to compliment and cut through gourmet fast food - like burgers.
