 <p>Why should I use Gillette Clear Gel Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant?</p><p>Gillette Clear Gel Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant delivers 48 hours of odor and sweat protection without unsightly white marks on clothing or skin.</p><p><br /></p><p>Why do we perspire?</p><p>Sweating is your body's way of releasing excess heat and cooling itself. Sweating is natural under any condition, but sweating can be intensified by any number of elements, including warm weather, exercise, and stress.</p><p><br /></p><p>What's anti-perspirant?</p><p>Anti-perspirants help to block the flow of sweat from sweat glands, thus reducing wetness. Because perspiration stimulates odor-causing bacteria, anti-perspirants also reduce body odor. Additionally, most anti-perspirants are scented, so they fight odor even more.</p><p><br /></p><p>How does anti-perspirant work?</p><p>Anti-perspirants use sweat against itself. Anti-perspirants help to reduce sweat by forming a superficial layer of plugs just below the skin's surface, which help to reduce sweat. Generally, the plugs will stay in place for about 24 hours and are then washed away over time.</p>

Its anti-white mark and yellow stain formula is dermatologically tested and alcohol free* so you can feel fresh, dry and protected all day long without worrying about irritation. This anti-perspirant deodorant for men contains Sure's innovative MotionSense technology which releases bursts of fresh and clean fragrance with a citrus kick when you need it most. It works like this: unique microcapsules sit on the surface of your skin. When you move, friction breaks those microcapsules releasing more fragrance. So, the more you move, the more it protects. That energising scent stays with you no matter how hard you push yourself. Because when you work hard, Sure works harder. Wear what you like. Move when you want. You know you're protected. Sure. It won't let you down. Have the confidence to move beyond your limits with Sure Invisible Ice Fresh anti-perspirant men's deodorant spray. Firstly, shake the can. Then hold it 15 centimetres away from your underarm and spray evenly in a well-ventilated area. Avoid contact with eyes and broken skin. This anti-perspirant deodorant is assembled in a factory using 100% renewable grid electricity. Made with infinitely recyclable aluminium, the compressed 200ml can is smaller but lasts just as long as its 250ml equivalent. Please recycle.

1383,302270661,St. Ives Pink Lemon & Orange Face Scrub 150Ml,"Bye bye dullness! From the UKâs #1 scrub brand*, this delicious, citrusy face scrub is infused with pink lemon and mandarin peel extract and polishes away little imperfections. These vibrant, zingy fruits are famous for leaving skin brighter. When life gives you lemons, make a delicious citrusy facial scrub. Infused with pink lemons and mandarin orange peel, it has a moderate exfoliation level for radiant skin. Use it 3â4 times a week for beautifully polished skin that glows. Dermatologically tested, oil free & non-comedogenic (meaning it doesn't block your pores). The Science of Exfoliation: Did you know your skin is constantly renewing itself? Basically, your body is always making new skin cells: while you sleep, while you eat, during class or morning status meetings at work- you get the point! However, the process isnât perfect. Sometimes these old cells donât flake off quickly enough; this build-up can leave you with a rough, dull, tired-looking complexions. Enter the exfoliating face scrub! Used correctly, these deep facial cleansers can help boost radiance by gently buffing away leftover dead skin cells. Properly exfoliated skin looks fresher, smoother, and downright glow-ier. How to use: 1.Squeeze a small size amount onto your fingertips and massage into damp skin. Spread in small circular motions, applying gentle pressure to wake your skinâs natural circulation. 2.Work all over, right up to your hairline and onto the sides of your nose. 3.When youâre done, rinse and pat dry with a clean towel. Use 3-4 times a week (depending on skin) for best results. *Based on Nielsen scantrack (total UK, excluding NI) data for female facial scrub market, 12-months to 23rd March 2019","{'bc1': 'Health & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Face Skincare', 'bc3': 'Face Cleansing', 'bc4': 'Face Scrub'}",https://digitalcontent.api.tesco.com/v2/media/ghs/c77098ff-3aa0-4e89-ac02-ad7cc501ea65/db7ef5c4-1a4d-4bb9-af8c-bbeff1245def_173497580.jpeg?h=225&w=225,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/302270661,4.0,female,female,0.47731492944525,0.26493120333018905,0.257753867224561,0.47731492944525,,,

preparationAndUsage
 Tip 1: Warm water softens thick and stubborn hairs and allows for more of the hair to be exposed from beneath the skin. Wash your face thoroughly for about two to three minutes before shaving for an optimal result. <br />Tip 2: For a particularly close shave, use shaving gel or soap. This also ensures that the blades of your razor glide easily over the skin, protecting against shaving irritation. Shave without pressure. <br />Tip 3: After shaving, cool water not only removes hair debris and residual shaving gel, but also closes the pores of your skin, for a smooth finish.<br />Tip 4: Replace the blades of your Wilkinson Sword razor regularly (depending on your shaving routine). If you find your blade no longer glides easily over the skin, it's time to change. Dull blades cannot shave as thoroughly and are more likely to cause skin irritation as you push harder against your skin.","{'bc1': 'Toiletries & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Mens Toiletries', 'bc3': 'Razors & Blades', 'bc4': 'Razors'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/63a121eb-bc78-42d4-9a44-f45d2742f20c/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/wilkinson-sword-hydro-sense-energize-razor-4-blades/109679416,9.0,male,male,0.27531509941948973,0.5404994901065082,0.1841854104740021,0.5404994901065082,,,

 Quality skincare every day<br />We understand the importance of quality everyday products that care for skin with minimal fuss.<br /><br />For 70 years, E45 has been a skincare expert in dry and itchy skin and treatment for eczema, psoriasis, ichthyosis and other dry skin conditions. It has proven dermatological expertise thatâs dedicated to vulnerable dry skin.<br /><br />The E45 range of skincare products has been developed for different skin types and different parts of the body. It works hard to protect and maintain skin health, while E45 Cream and E45 Itch Relief Cream can also improve dry skin health at every application.<br /><br />The voice of experience<br />In 1952 we released our first product â E45 cream. It was created by a Boots chemist in response to a customer request for a product that would soothe and protect the skin.<br /><br />In 1963 physicians noticed E45 cream was a beneficial treatment for dry skin conditions. At this time, we only promoted our products to hospital sales departments. It wasnât until 1980 that E45 cream was introduced to the pharmacy and retail establishments, where it was recognised for its efficacy in the treatment of dry skin.<br /><br />In the 1990s we extended our product range to include a complete skincare emollient therapy. Weâve continued to create products with patients and their skin in mind. We strive to continue to serve the needs of both patients and healthcare professionals and produce better treatment options for patientsâ skincare routines.
