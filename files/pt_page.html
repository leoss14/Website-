    <!-- BACKGROUND -->
    <section id="overview">
        <span class="section-label">Background</span>
        <h2>Concepts &amp; Research Design</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>The "pink tax"</strong> refers to the observation that consumer products marketed
            toward women are priced higher than comparable products aimed at men. The term is widely
            used in media and policy debates, but the empirical evidence is mixed. Some studies find
            price premiums on specific items (deodorants, lotions), while others conclude that apparent
            gaps largely reflect differences in product composition rather than discriminatory pricing.
            Gonzalez Guittar et al. (2022) studied over 3,000 products and found selective premiums,
            though men paid more for shaving products. Moshary et al. (2023), using Nielsen scanner
            data with product ingredient controls, concluded that price gaps reflect product
            differentiation rather than a systematic "tax."
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Gender classification</strong> is the first challenge. Many products signal gender
            through color choices, language, and brand names rather than stating it explicitly. With
            roughly 21,000 products in this dataset, manual labeling is impractical. This project
            automates the task using a supervised classifier trained on products with explicit gender
            terms (e.g. "for women", "men's"), then applies it to label the remaining products.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>TF-IDF</strong> (term frequency-inverse document frequency) converts product text
            into numerical vectors by measuring how distinctive each word is within the dataset. Words
            that appear frequently in one product but rarely across all products receive higher weights.
            This allows the classifier to learn which terms are associated with gendered products.
            <strong>K-means clustering</strong>, used here for color extraction, groups pixel RGB values
            from product images into clusters to identify the most prevalent colors in each image.
        </p>

        <div class="divider"><span>Research Question</span></div>

        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: var(--navy); font-weight: 600; text-align: center; max-width: 720px; margin: 0 auto 2.5rem;">
            Do products marketed to women cost more than comparable products for men in UK
            supermarkets? And if so, does the gap persist after controlling for product category?
        </p>

        <p>
            The central finding is that apparent price differences between gendered products are driven
            by category composition, not within-category discrimination. Female products are concentrated
            in lower-priced categories (personal care, period products), while male products span a wider
            range including premium grooming items. Once product category is accounted for, the price gap
            becomes statistically insignificant.
        </p>

        <div class="divider"><span>Analytical Approach</span></div>

        <p>
            The analysis proceeds in two stages. First, <strong>supervised classification</strong>
            labels products by target gender using text features (TF-IDF vectors from product
            descriptions and category breadcrumbs), color features (dominant colors extracted from
            product images via K-means), and metadata (store, price). Five classifiers are compared,
            from logistic regression to histogram gradient boosting. Second, <strong>OLS and quantile
            regressions</strong> with progressively added controls (store fixed effects, category fixed
            effects, description TF-IDF) estimate the price differential between female and male
            products. The key test is whether the female coefficient remains significant after
            controlling for product category.

    <!-- DATA -->
    <section>
        <span class="section-label">Data</span>
        <h2>Sources &amp; Preparation</h2>

        <p>
            The dataset contains 21,436 products scraped from Tesco, Morrisons, and ASDA. Categories
            unlikely to be gendered (food, electronics, pet supplies, cleaning products) were excluded,
            leaving 12,832 products in categories such as personal care, cosmetics, and toiletries.
        </p>

        <div class="two-col">
            <div class="note-box">
                <h4 style="color: var(--accent);">Training Labels</h4>
                <p>
                    Two sources: (1) explicit gender terms extracted via regex from product text
                    ("for women", "men's", etc.), yielding 1,075 female and 844 male products;
                    (2) 259 products with independent human-coded labels from a separate validation
                    exercise. The training set was balanced to 844 samples per class (female, male,
                    neutral), producing 2,532 training observations split 75/25 into training
                    (1,905) and test (639) sets.

            </div>
            <div class="note-box">
                <h4 style="color: var(--accent);">Feature Construction</h4>
                <p>
                    329 features total. <strong>Text:</strong> TF-IDF vectors from product descriptions
                    (150 features) and category breadcrumbs (80 features). <strong>Color:</strong>
                    dominant colors extracted from product images using K-means, mapped to 31 named
                    colors, producing 93 binary features (3 color slots &times; 31 colors).
                    <strong>Metadata:</strong> store ID, price, and unit price (6 features).

        <h3>Color Extraction</h3>

        <p>
            For products with accessible image URLs, the three most dominant colors were extracted
            using K-means clustering on pixel RGB values, then matched to the nearest named color
            from a 31-color palette. Color data was successfully extracted for 5,619 products, all
            from Morrisons. Tesco and ASDA image URLs had expired at the time of extraction, yielding
            a 0% success rate across those domains. This coverage limitation means color-based
            findings should be interpreted with caution.

            <h2>Gender Classification</h2>

            <p>
                The classification task assigns each product to one of three classes: female, male,
                or neutral. Five classifiers were tested on a 75/25 train-test split. Performance is
                measured on the held-out test set (639 samples). The models range from simple linear
                classifiers (logistic regression with L1 or L2 regularization) to ensemble methods
                (gradient boosting, random forest) that combine many decision trees to capture
                nonlinear relationships and handle sparse or missing features.

            <p>
                Histogram gradient boosting performed best, likely because it handles sparse features
                and missing values (many products lack color data) natively, without requiring
                imputation. Per-class precision and recall range from 77% to 82% across all three
                classes, with the neutral class achieving the highest recall at 86%. The model is
                conservative: it tends to classify uncertain products as neutral, leading to
                under-classification of gendered products rather than false positives.
            </p>

            <div class="divider"><span>Human Validation</span></div>

            <p>
                The test set above uses labels derived from explicit text patterns, which may not
                reflect how humans would categorize products. A stricter validation uses 200 products
                with independent human labels. On this set, the best model achieves 70% accuracy.
                The drop from 79% to 70% is expected: human coders pick up on subtler gendered
                marketing cues (brand positioning, imagery, packaging design) that text and color
                features miss.

                Brand names are strong predictors: "Lynx" for male is among the top features.
                Category breadcrumbs also encode gender: UK retailers place "toiletries" in
                male-coded sections and "removal" (hair removal) in female-coded sections, even

    <!-- COLOR ANALYSIS -->

        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Color Patterns</h3>

        <p>
            The charts below show color distributions in explicitly gendered products alongside
            LASSO coefficients indicating which colors predict each gender class. LASSO
            (L1-regularized logistic regression) shrinks irrelevant feature weights to zero,
            isolating the colors that carry the strongest classification signal.
        </p>

        <div class="chart-caption">
            <h4>Color Frequency by Gender</h4>
            <p>Share of each dominant color among explicitly gendered products. Sample sizes are small (n &#8776; 32 per group), so these distributions are indicative rather than definitive.</p>

        <p>
            The patterns match expectations: pinks, purples, and lavender are associated with
            female products; black, brown, and navy with male products. Some results are less
            intuitive: tan has a strong female coefficient, likely driven by foundation and
            cosmetics packaging. These associations reflect marketing conventions rather than
            any inherent property of the colors.
        </p>

        <h3>Marginal Contribution of Color Features</h3>

        <p>
            To isolate the contribution of color features, the same L1 logistic regression
            was trained with and without the 93 color-based features. The comparison measures
            the marginal gain from adding color information on top of text and metadata inputs.

                The table above uses L1 logistic regression (the weakest classifier, F1 = 0.646)
                on the full training set, where 56% of rows have zero-filled color columns
                because Tesco and ASDA image URLs had expired. This dilutes any color signal.

            <h2>Estimating the Pink Tax</h2>

            <p>
                With gender labels assigned, the second stage estimates the price differential
                between female- and male-targeted products. All regressions use log-transformed
                prices as the dependent variable, so coefficients approximate percentage differences
                (a coefficient of -0.10 corresponds to roughly a 10% price gap). Standard errors are
                heteroskedasticity-robust (HC1), which accounts for unequal variance across
                observations and guards against misleading confidence intervals.
            </p>
            <p>
                The analytical strategy is to add controls progressively. If the female coefficient
                becomes insignificant after controlling for product category, the implication is that
                the raw price gap reflects composition effects (women's and men's products fall into
                different product types with different baseline prices) rather than within-category
                pricing discrimination.
            </p>

            <h3>Raw Price Comparison</h3>

            <p>
                Among the 1,919 explicitly gendered products (1,075 female, 844 male), female
                products have a lower mean price (&pound;7.03 vs. &pound;8.15) and lower median
                (&pound;4.00 vs. &pound;4.50). This is the opposite of what a simple "pink tax"
                narrative would predict.

                The table below shows how the female price coefficient changes as controls are

                on price. "Fixed effects" (FE) are dummy variables for each store or category,
                allowing the model to compare products within the same store or product type
                rather than across them.

    <!-- THREE-WAY COMPARISON -->
    <section>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Gendered vs. Ungendered Products</h3>

        <p>
            A three-way comparison using all 12,832 products (with ungendered products as the
            reference group) shows that both gendered categories are cheaper than ungendered
            products, with female products especially so. Female products are 16.4% cheaper than
            ungendered ones (p &lt; 0.001), while male products are 2.9% cheaper (not significant).
            This suggests gendered products as a whole occupy lower price tiers than the broader
            product mix, rather than female-targeted products being marked up.

        <p>
            Only 11 product categories contain at least 3 female and 3 male products, limiting
            the scope of within-category comparisons. For these categories, the median price gap
            is +7.4% (female more expensive) and the weighted mean is +26.2%, though this average
            is heavily influenced by outlier categories with very small sample sizes. Most individual
            gaps are not statistically significant, based on bootstrap confidence intervals (1,000

            <p>
                The +259% outlier in incontinence products is driven by only 3 male comparison
                products, making it unreliable. The greeting cards category shows a more consistent
                pattern (+10-25% across sub-categories, one significant), though this likely reflects
                product differentiation (birthday cards for women may include different materials or
                designs) rather than identical items at different prices. The shower category shows
                the reverse: male products are more expensive, driven by premium grooming brands.
                The direction and magnitude of the gap depends entirely on the product category.

        <p>
            OLS estimates the effect on the conditional mean, producing a single average price gap.
            Quantile regression instead estimates the gap at different points of the price
            distribution: the 10th percentile (budget products), the median, the 90th percentile
            (premium products), and so on. This reveals whether any pricing asymmetry operates
            differently at the cheap versus expensive ends of the market.

                floor-price effect: budget female products start at a higher baseline, even if mid-range
                and premium products are priced similarly. However, the small number of categories and

        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Variation by Store</h3>

        <p>
            Running the raw-gap regression separately by store reveals substantial heterogeneity.
            Morrisons shows a large and significant female discount of 18.6% (p &lt; 0.001), while
            the other two stores show no significant gap. A female &times; store interaction model
            confirms this: the Morrisons interaction is significant (p &lt; 0.001) with a total
            female effect of &minus;50.6%, while the other stores show no significant interaction.
            This suggests pricing patterns vary by retailer and that aggregating across stores
            masks meaningful differences.

                        Female products are 9-10% cheaper in raw comparisons, and the gap becomes
                        statistically insignificant (reversing sign to +3.7%) after controlling for
                        product category. The unit price regression shows essentially zero difference
                        (+0.7%, p = 0.92). This aligns with Moshary et al.'s conclusion that price
                        differences between gendered products are explained by product differentiation,
                        not discriminatory pricing.

                        The R&sup2; jump from 0.006 to 0.672 when adding category fixed effects is
                        the critical result. Female products are concentrated in lower-priced

                        span a wider price range. The raw gap reflects where gendered products sit
                        in the category hierarchy, not pricing discrimination within categories.
