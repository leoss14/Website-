 The HD Polar Optics are the ideal polarised sunglasses for any activity outdoors that could involve having to see in bright sunlight, but these are no ordinary sunglasses. Most sunglasses just dim your overall vision, but the HD Polar Optics reduce glare without reducing clarity or colour, as well as enhancing the visible contrast to let you see detail and objects that would just be dimmed by ordinary sunglasses. This makes the HD Polar Optics the perfect polarised glasses for activities such as driving, sailing, fishing, birdwatching and any activities that require you to have clear, unfiltered vision with full protection and little or no glare.","{'bc1': 'Toiletries & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Holiday Shop', 'bc3': 'Sun Care'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/c0c8bd45-f4df-4f6d-9160-3db0f1a08b28/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/jml-polaoptics-black-high-definition-sunglasses/114055907,19.99,none,female,0.47489424974162825,0.20595457073152743,0.31915117952684435,0.47489424974162825,,,

 <p>Why should I use Gillette Clear Gel Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant?</p><p>Gillette Clear Gel Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant delivers 48 hours of odor and sweat protection without unsightly white marks on clothing or skin.</p><p><br /></p><p>Why do we perspire?</p><p>Sweating is your body's way of releasing excess heat and cooling itself. Sweating is natural under any condition, but sweating can be intensified by any number of elements, including warm weather, exercise, and stress.</p><p><br /></p><p>What's anti-perspirant?</p><p>Anti-perspirants help to block the flow of sweat from sweat glands, thus reducing wetness. Because perspiration stimulates odor-causing bacteria, anti-perspirants also reduce body odor. Additionally, most anti-perspirants are scented, so they fight odor even more.</p><p><br /></p><p>How does anti-perspirant work?</p><p>Anti-perspirants use sweat against itself. Anti-perspirants help to reduce sweat by forming a superficial layer of plugs just below the skin's surface, which help to reduce sweat. Generally, the plugs will stay in place for about 24 hours and are then washed away over time.</p>

 TENA Pants Super are white, soft and comfortable, disposable incontinence pants for men and women with pull up fit just like regular underwear. With a close body-fit and textile like, breathable materials they are designed for soft comfort. Unlike standard adult diapers, TENA Pants Super have a super absorbent core that quickly and effectively locks in liquid and give up to 100% security. When worn, the thin and flexible core shape forms two absorption channels, also known as the Dual Absorption Zone, that efficiently channel moisture away from the body for optimum dryness and protection. Integrated anti-leakage barriers provide additional security. Reliable protection against leakage for an active lifestyle and confidence, no matter the situation.

Using a scoop remove the soiled clump and dispose of with appropriate household waste. Replenish with a little more cat litter. At regular intervals the tray should be emptied completely and washed out with a mild household detergent such as washing up liquid.

 Beautiful smooth skin in 3 easy steps:<br />Before using, please read pack precautions carefully.<br /><br />For hair removal (takes between 2 - 6 minutes):<br />1 Apply Veet Expertâ¢ Hair Removal Cream evenly to fully coat the hair.<br />2 Leave the cream on your skin for 2 minutes, and then using the spatula gently remove a small test area of cream.

Perfect for dogs and cats, our claw file was also designed with rabbits and other small pets in mind. Ideal for smoothing the edges of clipped nails, our file is also well suited to simply reducing the sharpness of your petâs more prominent claws, ensuring they donât accidentally injure themselves or other pets. Curved to suit all paws and claws - Our Claw File is curved to follow the contour of your pets claws, no matter the size. Filing our pets claws can be a stressful experience for them. Introducing a curve to our file ensures you can delicately and precisely follow the natural contours of your pets individual claws, making the experience as fast and stress free as possible. Maintain claw health - Our pets have their own natural methods to file down their claws, but sometimes they need a little help, especially as they get older. Regular claw maintenance ensures your pets claws stay at an ideal length, preventing them from hooking round into paw pads, and preventing accidental injury to themselves or damage to their surroundings. Ergonomic handle - Including a rubberised thumb grip, our file handle is ergonomically designed to ensure grip, comfort and precision. When tending to our pets claws itâs important to be precise, and a good grip is tantamount.

4426,258964068,Simple Kind To Eyes Eye Make-Up Remover Pads 30S,"Our Simple Kind to Skin Eye Make-Up Remover Pads effectively cleanse your eyes of make-up (including waterproof mascara) and impurities whilst instantly hydrating the skin around your eyes, making them the perfect face wipes for dehydrated, dry, or sensitive skin. Cleansing plays an important part in a healthy skincare regime. However, some eye make-up removers are harsh and can strip away natural oils, making the skin around your eyes feel tight, dry and dehydrated. This is why you should choose a cleanser for sensitive skin. Our eye pads are infused with skin-essential minerals and a plant extract and do not contain any artificial colours or perfume, or any harsh chemicals that can upset your skin. These eye pads are part of the Simple Kind to Skin range and are specifically designed to leave skin healthy and happy. Why not try out our other products in the Simple Kind to Skin range to help keep your skin hydrated? After using Simple Kind to Skin Eye Pads, we recommend cleansing your face with Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water. Finish your routine by smoothing Simple Hydrating Gel Cream into your face and neck to instantly moisturise your skin and complete your hydration skincare routine. Make sure to also try our Kind to Skin Eye Roll On, Dark Circle Cream, Under Eye Cream, Dual Effect Eye Make-Up Remover, and Eye Balm!","{'bc1': 'Health & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Face Skincare', 'bc3': 'Make Up Remover', 'bc4': 'Eye Make Up Remover'}",https://digitalcontent.api.tesco.com/v2/media/ghs/b0347cba-3f4e-43f1-b35f-18e7acd26b9c/bb1fddfb-15ef-4232-83e0-27b10ce36df3_433385658.jpeg?h=225&w=225,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/258964068,2.5,none,female,0.3792888202996125,0.3607501961380963,0.2599609835622912,0.3792888202996125,,,

preparationAndUsage
 Tip 1: Warm water softens thick and stubborn hairs and allows for more of the hair to be exposed from beneath the skin. Wash your face thoroughly for about two to three minutes before shaving for an optimal result. <br />Tip 2: For a particularly close shave, use shaving gel or soap. This also ensures that the blades of your razor glide easily over the skin, protecting against shaving irritation. Shave without pressure. <br />Tip 3: After shaving, cool water not only removes hair debris and residual shaving gel, but also closes the pores of your skin, for a smooth finish.<br />Tip 4: Replace the blades of your Wilkinson Sword razor regularly (depending on your shaving routine). If you find your blade no longer glides easily over the skin, it's time to change. Dull blades cannot shave as thoroughly and are more likely to cause skin irritation as you push harder against your skin.","{'bc1': 'Toiletries & Beauty', 'bc2': 'Mens Toiletries', 'bc3': 'Razors & Blades', 'bc4': 'Razors'}",https://groceries.morrisons.com/images-v3/4b85987b-1398-4173-a0c1-3546047c9d74/fdb880d8-abce-4a7a-a5df-ff65538a6f5c/500x500.webp,https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/wilkinson-sword-hydro-5-mens-razor-/108058669,8.5,male,male,0.08214559263560853,0.8979829019362511,0.019871505428140302,0.8979829019362511,,,

Let me introduce you to a bubbly world of fun. This playful, foaming bubble bath for kids uses a mild, dermatologically tested, and pH-neutral formula thatâs suitable for sensitive skin. Thanks to our gentle, hypoallergenic bubble bath, you can watch your childrenâs happiness blossom as they make and pop harmless bubbles while you take in the sweet black raspberry aroma. A bottle of Matey lasts for up to 30 baths; once youâve used up all the bubble bath, the empty container can be washed out and used as a toy. Warning: itâs not safe for children under 36 months to play with as the small parts are choking hazards. How to use: Matey Bubble Bath is for external use only. Keep out of reach of children. Add it to the stream of running water and swish by hand to create lots of bubbly fun. If splashed in the eyes, rinse thoroughly with clean water. When using our bubble bath, never leave a child unattended in water, a bath, or the bathroom. Matey was first launched in 1958, created to make sure that bath time was fun time. Upon the success of Sailor Matey, the Matey family quickly grew to be a top kidsâ favourite. Choose from characters such as Hamina Matey, her best friends Max, Molly, and Jasper Matey to join you on your bathtime adventure.","{'bc1': 'Baby & Toddler', 'bc2': 'Baby & Toddler Toiletries', 'bc3': 'Toddler Bath Time & Haircare', 'bc4': 'Kids Bodywash & Bubblebath'}",https://digitalcontent.api.tesco.com/v2/media/ghs/ecc901b4-93bc-48a4-962b-7318567cfc5f/99a867fe-88ad-435d-b87f-692905a3db7d_45373934.jpeg?h=225&w=225,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/313751248,2.5,female,none,0.2184655615900306,0.2716605411147486,0.5098738972952208,0.5098738972952208,,,
